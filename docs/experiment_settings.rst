Customizing Experiments
==========================

An experiment is rendered with several independant components:

* A parallel plot
* An XY graph
* A table that displays individual rows

It's possible to customize how the data is rendered.

.. literalinclude:: ../hiplot/test_experiment.py
    :start-after: EXPERIMENT_SETTINGS_SNIPPET1_BEGIN
    :end-before: EXPERIMENT_SETTINGS_SNIPPET1_END
